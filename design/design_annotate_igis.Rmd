## Objective

We would like to be able to use existing R APIs for annotating genes based on gene IDs as the starting point. Thereby we can keep up to date with new `Ensembl` versions that are published and are flexible whether IGIS (gRED) or GI-HDAP (pRED) is used.

For gRED molecules, the canonical source for `Ensembl` (`Entrez` for legacy) annotations is IGIS. Therefore we want to be able to fetch the required feature data columns for the genes based on the IDs from IGIS. 

Fortunately, the nice R-package `igis` is available. 

## Workflow

1. Establish a connection to data base
  - provide a wrapper that loads the right IGIS version based on the gene IDs.
  - e.g. `connection <- connect(prefix = prefix(object), db = "igis")` where `object` is a `HermesData` object and `db` identifies the data base to use.
  - `prefix()` is a new generic function/method to access slot of same name in HermesData object: it is either "ENSG" or "GeneID" and filled at creation.
  - In the future we might have other data bases, such as the pRED one, to connect to.
  - then `connection` result has a class: here `Igis`
  - internally that calls `igis::Igis` where we use "human" species and the version is determined
    by the gene IDs format found in `object`.
2. Then annotate the HermesData object
  - e.g. define an `annotation` method: this can have a getter function, where we just give back
    the relevant data frame columns from `rowData(object)`.
  - and then the replacement method can be used like:
    `annotation(object) <- query(genes = genes(object), connection)`
  - `genes()` is a new method for generic defined in package `GenomicFeatures` to access gene names in object
  - So here we need a new generic function `query` and a method for `character`, `Igis` signature.

## Prototypes

### Additional prefix slot and getter method

Just for illustration we create a new class here, but it would be the same for `HermesData` and `RangedHermesData`: just an additional slot `prefix`.

```{r}
# this will be folded into both HermesData and RangedHermesData class definitions:
.HD <- setClass(
  Class = "HD",
  contains = "HermesData",
  slots = c(prefix = "character")
)

# this will be like this:
setGeneric("prefix", def = function(object, ...) {
  object@prefix
})

# the constructor then also fills the prefix slot - this will later be folded into HermesData()
# constructor:
HD <- function(object) {
  start <- HermesData(object)
  gene_ids <- rownames(object)
  prefix <- if (all(grepl("^ENSG", gene_ids))) {
    "ENSG"
  } else if (all(grepl("^GeneID", gene_ids))) {
    "GeneID"
  } else {
    stop("hermes currently only supports EnsemblID or EntrezID as gene IDs")
  }
  .HD(
    start,
    prefix = prefix
  )
}
```

### Example

So now our typical example is:

```{r}
object <- HD(summarized_experiment)
prefix(object)
```


### genes getter method

Actually this is just a synonym for `rownames()` really.
In order to ensure that, we need to add another validation check for HermesData objects:
we require that its rownames equal the GeneID column in rowData.

```{r}
library(igis)

#' @importFrom GenomicFeatures genes
setMethod(
  f = "genes",
  signature = c(x = "AnyHermesData"),
  definition = function(x, ...) {
    rownames(x)
  }
)

# later assert this via validation method:
identical(rownames(object), rowData(object)$GeneID)

# then we can safely use this:
head(genes(object))
```

### Connection function

As mentioned above, this can later be extended easily to other `db` options.

```{r}
connect <- function(prefix = c("ENSG", "GeneID"), db = "igis") {
  prefix <- match.arg(prefix)
  db <- match.arg(db)
  if (db == "igis") {
    version <- switch(prefix,
      ENSG = "4.0",
      GeneID = "3.0"
    )
    igis::Igis(species = "human", version = version)
  }
}

connection <- connect(prefix(object))
class(connection)
```

### annotation method

This gives back the relevant data frame columns from `rowData(object)`.

```{r}
# Define a package constant:
.row_data_annotation_cols <- c(
  "symbol",
  "desc",
  "GeneID",
  "chromosome",
  "size"
)

#' @importFrom BiocGenerics annotation
setMethod(
  f = "annotation",
  signature = c(object = "AnyHermesData"),
  definition = function(object, ...) {
    rowData(object)[, .row_data_annotation_cols]
  }
)

head(annotation(object))
```

### query method

Now we are ready to query from Igis e.g. - again we define this as a generic function so that it
can be easily extended once we need other connections.

```{r}
setGeneric("query", def = function(genes, connection) {})

setMethod(
  f = "query",
  signature = c(genes = "character", connection = "Igis"),
  definition = function(genes, connection) {
    trans <- igis::transcriptsByGeneId(
      geneIds = genes,
      canonical = TRUE,
      igis = connection
    )
    df <- cbind(
      setNames(
        mcols(trans),
        c(
          "symbol",
          "GeneID",
          "desc"
        )
      ),
      Chromosome = as.vector(seqnames(trans)),
      StartBP = start(trans),
      EndBP = end(trans),
      WidthBP = width(trans)
    )
    rownames(df) <- genes
    df[, .row_data_annotation_cols]
  }
)
```

Let's try this out:

```{r}
new_annotations <- query(genes(object), connection)
head(new_annotations)
```

Note: If there is too much time delay between the connection creation and the query, then the error:
````
could not run statement: MySQL server has gone away 
````
can be thrown. In that case just create a new connection again.

### Annotation replacement method

This basically just uses the data frame replacement method: That part of the `rowData` which is the
annotation gets replaced with the provided data frame.

```{r}
setReplaceMethod(
  f = "annotation",
  signature = c(object = "AnyHermesData", value = "DataFrame"),
  function(object, value) {
    # In production add here more checks/assertions if needed (e.g. test
    # whether wrong things could be inserted here into rowData) -
    # do we need to align the row names etc.
    # and then finally insert:
    rowData(object)[, .row_data_annotation_cols] <- value[, .row_data_annotation_cols]
    object
  }
)
```

Let's try:

```{r}
# first remove some info
# rowData(object)[, "CanonicalTranscript"] <- ""

# then fill in
annotation(object) <- new_annotations

head(annotation(object))
```

But the class of object is still:

```{r}
class(object)
rd <- rowData(object)
head(rd)
head(annotation(object))
```


### Annotation feature: getting gene type

Gene type can be found using `igis::variationConsequence()`, in the `biotype` slot. 

#### Single gene lookup

For a single gene this works well:

```{r}
connection <- connect_igis("ENSG")
gene <- "ENSG00000163734"

transcripts <- igis::transcriptsByGeneId(
  geneIds = gene,
  canonical = TRUE,
  igis = connection
)
class(transcripts)
transcripts

cons <- igis::variationConsequence(
  igis = connection,
  allele = "T",
  location = transcripts,
  species = "human"
)

cons$biotype
```

#### Multiple genes lookup

So probably we can do the same principle as what was done for `igis::transcriptsByGeneId()` in that instead of providing one specific gene, we provide a list of all genes. Note that below we also have the other prefix (`GeneID` which means `Entrez` or IGIS version 3).

```{r}
object <- HermesData(summarized_experiment)
prefix(object)
connection <- connect_igis(prefix(object))

all_transcripts <- igis::transcriptsByGeneId(
  geneIds = genes(object),
  canonical = TRUE,
  igis = connection
)

all_transcripts
```

So let's try this:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
all_cons <- igis::variationConsequence(
  igis = connection,
  allele = "T",
  location = all_transcripts,
  species = "human"
)
```

This gives

````
Error in getListElement(x, i, ...) : 
  GRanges objects don't support [[, as.list(), lapply(), or unlist() at the moment
````

So seems to me that there is a bug in `igis` here. 
I looked this up on Google and found other people reporting this, and being referred to R 4.0.3 with later BioConductor release. I tested this in my local RStudio with R 4.0.3 and indeed this runs there fine:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
library(igis)
connection <- Igis(species = "human", version = "4.0")
genes <- c("ENSG00000163734", "ENSG00000163735")
transcripts <- igis::transcriptsByGeneId(
  geneIds = genes,
  canonical = TRUE,
  igis = connection
)
cons <- variationConsequence(
  igis = connection,
  allele = "T",
  location = transcripts,
  species = "human"
)
cons$biotype
```

As the NEST team overall will switch to R 4.0.x in the next cycle, it seems
better to postpone this feature implementation to the next cycle.

#### Alternative considered

As an alternative we could have worked around this for now, e.g. via querying each range separately:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
for (i in 1:length(genes(object))) {
  gene_type <- igis::variationConsequence(
    allele = "T",
    location = transcripts[i, ],
    igis = connection,
    species = "human"
  )

  df <- cbind(transcripts[i, ], gene_type$biotype)
}
```

However this will be pretty slow, so does not seem like a good option.
Also, the feature request is not urgent at all, so it's fine to have this in
an upcoming release.
