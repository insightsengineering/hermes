## Objective

Background: we want to open source `hermes` soon and then IGIS is not available, therefore users need an open source path to the annotations. This would be `biomaRt`.
Note: For ease of typing we use `biomart` in the code, i.e. with small `r`.

## Information about `biomaRt`

* https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/devel/bioc/vignettes/biomaRt/inst/doc/accessing_ensembl.html
* `vignette("biomaRt", "biomaRt")`
  - `getBM()` is the main function. 
  - `attributes` is what we want to receive - all the annotation columns.
  - `filters` is describing which input we give - in our case the `ID` variable.
  - `values` vector - the gene IDs.
  - `mart` - the connection.

## Connection function

It seems like the same data base is used for both prefixes. Still we need to save the used prefix
such that later in the query we know it. For this we make a new class that has additional prefix slot again.

```{r}
library(biomaRt)
library(hermes)

.ConnectionBiomart <- setClass( # nolint
  "ConnectionBiomart",
  contains = "Mart",
  slots = c(prefix = "character")  
)
```

Now the connection function is easy.

```{r}
connect_biomart <- function(prefix = c("ENSG", "GeneID")) {
  prefix <- match.arg(prefix)
  .ConnectionBiomart(
    biomaRt::useMart("ensembl", dataset = "hsapiens_gene_ensembl"),
    prefix = prefix
  )
}
```

(Note: For now everything is only on human genes, therefore we hard code the dataset used above.
In the future this will become more flexible so that we can cover other species.)

Let's first setup a `HermesData` object which includes annotations already, 
so we have something to compare against.

```{r}
object <- hermes_data
```

Let's try it.

```{r}
connection <- connect_biomart(prefix(object))
connection
class(connection)
isS4(connection)
connection@prefix
```

Good. So we get back an S4 object of class `ConnectionBiomart`.

## Discovering how to do this

Let's first prototype a few snippets.

### Available data

Let's see which data we can query:

```{r}
fs <- listFilters(as(connection, "Mart"))
names(rowData(object)) # We look for these guys (except LowExpressionFlag).
```

It's nice that in RStudio Viewer we can easily search in this data set (so in `View(fs)`).

Note that unfortunately the `biomaRt::martCheck()` function is checking the class of the object with 
`class()` instead of `is()` and therefore we need to explicitly coerce our object to the `Mart` class
for using it.

### Gene stuff

Now let's say for the first genes in `object` we want to query:

```{r}
gene_ids <- c(
  "11185",
  "10677"
)
```

Note that we can't have the prefix.
Let's try the query:
  
```{r}
genestuff <- getBM(
  attributes = c(
    "entrezgene_id",
    "hgnc_symbol",
    "chromosome_name",
    "start_position",
    "end_position",
    "entrezgene_description"
  ),
  filters = "entrezgene_id",
  values = gene_ids,
  mart = as(connection, "Mart")
)
```

Note that currently (with R version 3.6.3) we get warnings about use of deprecated `dplyr` functions.
It seems like this is fixed upstream: https://github.com/Bioconductor/BiocFileCache/issues/23
so we will get the fix in the new R/BioConductor version in the next release cycle.

Let's see the results:

```{r}
genestuff
```

Note that we need to be careful here: the order in the results is not the same as in the inputs! Therefore
we also query the gene ID again so we can sort later correctly.

We can compare that with what we had in object (from IGIS):
```{r}
rowData(object)[1:2, ]
```

Details:
* Width we can calculate from start and end position ourselves.
* Unfortunately there is a limit on how many external attributes can be queries at once.

### Protein stuff

Let's try 
again to query the protein stuff:

```{r}
proteinstuff <- getBM(
  attributes = c(
    "entrezgene_id",
    "refseq_mrna",
    "refseq_peptide",
    "transcript_is_canonical"
  ),
  filters = c("entrezgene_id", "transcript_is_canonical"),
  values = list(gene_ids, TRUE),
  mart = as(connection, "Mart")
)

proteinstuff
```

Details:
* The protein transcript column can be obtained by taking those `refseq_peptide` rows where `transcript_is_canonical` is 1. 
* Similarly the canonical transcript column can be obtained from `refseq_mrna`.
* We do this directly in the query by specifying in filters and values.

## Query method

We need to break this in a couple of pieces.

### Stripping the prefix from the gene IDs

```{r}
h_strip_prefix <- function(gene_ids, prefix) {
  gsub(
    pattern = paste0("^", prefix, "[[:punct:]]?([[:digit:]]+)$"),
    replacement = "\\1",
    x = gene_ids
  )
}

h_strip_prefix(c("GeneID:11185", "GeneID:10677"), prefix = "GeneID")
```

### biomaRt query helper

```{r}
h_get_annotation_biomart <- function(gene_ids, 
                                     id_type, 
                                     mart) {
  df_gene <- biomaRt::getBM(
    attributes = c(
      id_type,
      "hgnc_symbol",
      "entrezgene_description",
      "chromosome_name",
      "start_position",
      "end_position"
    ),
    filters = id_type,
    values = gene_ids,
    mart = mart
  )
  df_protein <- biomaRt::getBM(
    attributes = c(
      id_type,
      "refseq_mrna",
      "refseq_peptide"
    ),
    filters = c(id_type, "transcript_is_canonical"),
    values = list(gene_ids, TRUE),
    mart = mart
  )
  df <- merge(df_gene, df_protein, by = id_type, all = TRUE)
  df <- df[match(gene_ids, df[[id_type]]), ]
  rownames(df) <- gene_ids
  df[, - which(colnames(df) == id_type)]
}
```

Try this.

```{r}
h_get_annotation_biomart(c("11185", "10677"), "entrezgene_id", as(connection, "Mart"))
```

### Define as a function (for easier testing)

```{r}
.query_biomart <- function(genes, connection) {
  pre <- prefix(connection)
  gene_ids <- if (pre == "GeneID") {
    h_strip_prefix(genes, prefix = pre)
  } else {
    genes
  }
  id_attribute <- switch(
    pre,
    GeneID = "entrezgene_id", 
    ENSG = "ensembl_gene_id"
  )
  mart <- as(connection, "Mart")
  df <- h_get_annotation_biomart(gene_ids, id_type = id_attribute, mart = mart)
  with(
    df,
    DataFrame(
      HGNC = hgnc_symbol,
      HGNCGeneName = entrezgene_description,
      Chromosome = as.character(chromosome_name),
      StartBP = start_position,
      EndBP = end_position,
      WidthBP = end_position - start_position + 1L,
      CanonicalTranscript = refseq_mrna,
      ProteinTranscript = refseq_peptide,
      row.names = genes
    )
  )
}
```

Let's try it out.

```{r}
new_genes <- c("GeneID:283887", "GeneID:101929152", "GeneID:100129543", "GeneID:283981", "GeneID:27244")
res_biomart <- .query_biomart(
  new_genes, 
  connection
)
```

Compare this with the IGIS results.

```{r}
res_biomart
rowData(object)[new_genes, ]
```

Hm, this shows that for quite a few genes we don't get any results.

Let's see if we query instead with the Ensembl ID:

```{r}
h_get_annotation_biomart("101929152", id_type = "entrezgene_id", mart = as(connection, "Mart"))
h_get_annotation_biomart("ENSG00000225764", id_type = "ensembl_gene_id", mart = as(connection, "Mart"))
```

This looks better. Hm. So let's try to convert the IDs first.

```{r}
bm_conversion <- getBM(
  filters = "entrezgene_id", 
  attributes = c("ensembl_gene_id", "entrezgene_id"), 
  values = h_strip_prefix(new_genes, "GeneID"), 
  mart = as(connection, "Mart")
)
bm_conversion
```

So this shows that 2 genes were not found given their Entrez ID. Generally, conversion between the 
two ID systems should be avoided (see e.g. discussion here: https://support.bioconductor.org/p/111608/ and https://support.bioconductor.org/p/115813/).

Now for the IDs that have been found:

```{r}
connection@prefix <- "ENSG"
res_ensembl_biomart <- .query_biomart(
  bm_conversion$ensembl_gene_id, 
  connection
)
res_ensembl_biomart
```

Everything works ok.
So it seems that this method of querying annotations only works well for Ensembl IDs. 
We could therefore restrict this for now to the "ENSG" prefix. Basically in a first release version
we would just support annotations for "ENSG" IDs. Which is ok since that seems to be more
standard than the older Entrez Gene IDs.

In addition, in production we need to: 
- make the annotation replacement method more flexible.
For example, there should be a warning to the user that certain genes could not be annotated
so they still have `NA`. 
- make the normalization method that requires gene width fail if a gene has `NA` width.
- make the filtering method have a new argument that specifies whether to filter out genes that don't have any annotation. So that once the object is filtered it could safely go into the normalization method.

Given this, it seems still ok to have the user query Entrez Gene IDs. They will just get less annotated
genes back like that. And we need to highlight the limitations in the documentation / vignette.

### Define the method

That is then easy, e.g.

```{r}
setMethod(
  f = "query",
  signature = c(genes = "character", connection = "Mart"),
  definition = .query_biomart
)
```
