## Objective

Update and replace the `draw_stackbar_chr()` function from `rnaseqTools` to use `ggplot2` and use an `HermesData` object as input.

## Idea

We need to access two rowData factors in the `HermesData` object: `Chromosome` and `LowExpressionFlag`, and then use ggplot function to draw stackbar. 

To make the plot easy to read, the `Chromosome` factor should be sorted to `1-22`, "X", "Y", "MT", "Others".

Use `ggplot()` and `geom_bar()` functions to create stack bar.

```{r}
#Creating the HermesData object and read rowData information

load("~/hermes/data/hermes_data.rda")

object <- hermes_data

df <- data.frame(Chromosome = rowData(object)$Chromosome, LowExpressionFlag = rowData(object)$LowExpressionFlag)

# Sort Chromosome factor
chrname <- c(as.character(c(1:22)), "X", "Y", "MT", "Others")
df$chr <- factor(ifelse(df$Chromosome %in% chrname, df$Chromosome, "Others"), levels = chrname)

# Use ggplot to create stackplot
ggplot(data=df, aes(x=chr))+ geom_bar(aes(fill = LowExpressionFlag))
```

Editing changes for the plots will be added later.

## Miscellaneous issue 1: the name of Chromosome

At this stage, the `Chromosome` factor is mandatory in `HermesData` object. However, its contents (i.e. the names of the chromosome) are not limited. In this setting, we force the names of the chromosomes to be `1`, `2`, ..., `22`, `X`, `Y`, `MT`. If the names are not in this list, they will be identified as `Others`. This setting is limited. For example, if a dataset includes chromosomes with names `chr1`, `chr2`, etc, they will all be counted as `Others`. This problem should be solved. 


* It will be good to have chromosome as an argument of the plotting function, with `c(as.character(c(1:22)), "X", "Y", "MT", "Others")` as a default, such that users could select less chromosomes e.g. to focus on if they like.


We may either force the Chromosome to have the names `1`, `2`, ..., `22`, `X`, `Y`, `MT` in the `HeremesData()` function, which could make our package to be limited. The other approach could be adding an option `use.original.chr.name`in the `draw_stackbar_chr()` function. If users choose  `use.original.chr.name = Y`, then we do not sort 
chromosome factors, and directly print a stack bars based on original chromosome names, which may be lengthy because there are lots of chromosomes such as `KI270734.1`, `GL000205.2` (i.e. unplaced geno).

* At this stage, we can just assert in the plotting function that chromosome column has this format. There will definitely be a standard for this and we will enforce this/ convert this in the constructor later.
 

## Miscellaneous issue 2: NA in LowExpressionFlag
As the `LowExpressionFlag` is optional in `HermesData` object. If a SE object does not include `LowExpressionFlag`,  `HermesData()` will add this factor into rowData with all values in NA. 

 
The `HermesData` object will lead to error message in ggplot since all `LowExpressionFlag` values are NA. We need one test in `assert_that()` to dectect if all values in the `LowExpressionFlag` are NA.
